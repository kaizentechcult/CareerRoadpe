          Honesty with Boundaries: Be truthful about your current CTC,
          including both fixed and variable components. However, you can choose
          to provide a rounded figure or a range to maintain some negotiation
          leverage.
        </ListElement>
        <ListElement>
          Highlight Your Value: Don&apos;t let the conversation solely revolve
          around your current CTC. Seize the opportunity to emphasize your
          skills, achievements, and the value you bring to the table.
        </ListElement>
        <ListElement>
          Shifting the Focus: Transition the conversation towards your
          expectations for the new position. Research market trends for similar
          roles and salary ranges in your field. This allows you to set
          realistic expectations based on your expertise.

          Embrace Flexibility: Expressing openness to negotiation demonstrates
          a collaborative spirit. Be prepared to discuss your desired
          compensation package within a reasonable range.

          Redirect the Focus: If disclosing your current CTC makes you
          uncomfortable, politely redirect the conversation towards your
          qualifications and how you can contribute to the company&apos;s
          success. Focus on the value you&apos;ll bring, not just the cost.
        </ListElement>
        <ListElement>
          The Power of &quots;Total Value&quots;: While salary is important,
          discuss non-monetary benefits that are valuable to you. This could
          include flexible work arrangements, professional development
          opportunities, or a strong company culture.
        </ListElement>
        <ListElement>
          Maintain Professionalism: Throughout the discussion, keep your tone
          professional and avoid overly personal disclosures. The goal is to
          strike a balance between honesty and strategic negotiation.

        By understanding the meaning of CTC, crafting a thoughtful response, and
        navigating the conversation skillfully, you can effectively address this
        often-dreaded question. Remember, you are not just a cost; you&apos;re a
        valuable asset with a unique skillset and a lot to offer.

        demonstrate your worth and initiate a constructive conversation about
        compensation. So, take a deep breath, know your value, and use this
